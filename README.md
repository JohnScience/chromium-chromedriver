# chromium-chromedriver

A Docker image that runs Chromium + chromedriver as a service.

At the moment, this image does not work. It is a work in progress. Unless it's stale. Then it's dead.

The discussion of how to fix the code is available at <https://github.com/ik1ne/webdriver-downloader/issues/59>.
